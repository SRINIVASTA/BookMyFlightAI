# BookMyF

This is a simple demonstration of a multi-agent AI system using Streamlit. The system simulates:

- A **Planning Agent** that searches for flights.
- A **Memory Agent** that retrieves user preferences.
- A **Booking Agent** that books a selected flight.
- A **Critic Agent** that validates flight options.
- An **Orchestrator** that manages and coordinates these agents.
